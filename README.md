Analysis for FUSA research
This repository contains a variety of projects performed on behalf of Families USA. Actuarial estimates were used in peer-reviewed paper and congressional testimony on CMS regulatory changes. ACS estimates were used in research brief on state budgetary changes and the impact on Medicaid Oral Health coverage. I also include earlier ggplot2 code used for my work with Fem Futures that could be useful for presentation visualization purposes later on. The code is in Stata and R.
